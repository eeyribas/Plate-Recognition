# Plate-Recognition
This repository contains a vehicle license plate recognition project. Images are captured from a Pi Camera connected to a Raspberry Pi. License plates are detected from these images using modules such as ALPR, CV2, and NumPy.
There are license plates stored in a text file. Detected plates are compared with these stored plates. Detected plates are then saved. The interface is developed using the Tkinter module.

Alpr-Module File: Contains examples tested with the ALPR module during the development of the license plate recognition project. These are examples developed for license plate recognition using the ALPR module.

CV2-Numpy-Pytesseract-Modules File: Contains examples tested with the cv2, numpy, and pytesseract modules during the development of the license plate recognition project.
