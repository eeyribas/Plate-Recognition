# Plate-Recognition
Contains a vehicle license plate recognition project. Images are captured using a Pi Camera connected to a Raspberry Pi. Plates are detected from these images using modules such as ALPR, CV2, and NumPy. 
The plates are stored in a text file. The detected plates are compared with the stored plates. If a match is found between the detected and stored plates, the plate is marked in the image. 
The interface is developed using the Tkinter module.
